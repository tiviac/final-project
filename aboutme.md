This project addresses the invisibility of stories from Guyanese women as intra-Caribbean migrants. While Caribbean migration is often discussed in terms of economics or legality, the emotional and material realities of migrants are less explored. The project highlights these stories and builds an space that affirms and documents their experiences. It demonstrates the importance of creating participatory spaces where marginalised voices are centered and their knowledge is preserved. It highlights their gendered experiences and ensures representation across age, gender, and class.

Please explore these stories with care and kindness. their lives are real... 

### My story

I lived in Trinidad and Tobago for 7 years... and it was a journey. This project is a space for me to reflect on my own experiences, and centre the living in the migration.

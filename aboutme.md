> This project addresses the invisibility of stories from Guyanese women as intra-Caribbean migrants. While Caribbean migration is often discussed in terms of economics or legality, the emotional and material realities of migrants are less explored. The project highlights these stories and builds an space that affirms and documents their experiences. It demonstrates the importance of creating participatory spaces where marginalised voices are centered and their knowledge is preserved. It highlights their gendered experiences and ensures representation across age, gender, and class.

Please explore these stories with care and kindness. their lives are real...

### About the Logo

The logo features a butterfly whose wings are tides and currents from the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Caribbean countries are visible in and around its wings. The body of the butterfly is a subtle compass, symbolizing direction, journey, and purpose.<br/>Butterflies are natural migrators, moving across great distances for survival, growth, and renewal. This mirrors the Caribbean migration storyâ€”people moving across borders for love, work, safety, opportunity, or belonging.

I left for love. Falling for a woman from Trinidad changed everything. It was scary, leaving behind my family and the only home I’d ever known, but I couldn’t keep hiding who I am.<br/> Being with her gave me the courage to start over somewhere I could live more openly. We break up now, but I still building an honest life. Love brought me here—and for the first time, I feel like I truly belong.

| Relationship       | Open, supportive, and affirming           | Secretive and restricted by norms       |
| Sense of Self      | Confident, free, and loved                | Anxious, constrained, and closeted      |

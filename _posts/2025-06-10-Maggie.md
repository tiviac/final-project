I’ve been selling at the market in Barbados for over ten years now. My stall is small—just fruits, herbs, and homemade pepper sauce—but it’s mine. I came here from Guyana when my children were still young. I didn’t have much choice. Things were tight, and I heard there was steady work here. A cousin helped me get started, and I’ve been building ever since.

At first, it was hard. People noticed my accent. Some would ask, “You from Guyana?” and not always in a good way. But I kept showing up. I kept working. Over time, customers came back not just for my pepper sauce, now that is big business for me.

The market is more than just work—it’s my life. I know who sells when and where, who comes early for thyme, and who stays late for a last-minute sale. It’s we place.

Some days I miss home—but I’ve built something here. My children went to school here. They now at UWI. I’ve made a name for myself.

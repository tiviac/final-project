Back home in Guyana, I used to stretch every dollar, but here in Trinidad, I finally feel like I can breathe a little. <br/> Having access to more resources means I can take care of my family and even start dreaming bigger for myself.

**Jen's access to freedom**

## How Migrating gave her resouces

“Moving to Trinidad opened doors—my education helped me find good work and feel like all my hard work finally mattered,” Jen says, reflecting on her journey from Guyana. Back home, she studied in business  but struggled to find steady employment that matched her qualifications. “It was frustrating, knowing I had the skills but not the opportunity,” she explains. The decision to leave wasn’t easy, but she knew she had to try something different.

In Trinidad, Jen found that her education was recognised and respected. “I got a job within a few months—nothing fancy at first, but it was a start. It paid better, and there was room to grow.” Over time, she moved into a more stable administrative role and began saving money. With this new financial freedom, she’s been able to send remittances home and support her younger siblings’ schooling.

For Jen, the move was not just about economic survival—it was about reclaiming the value of her efforts. “Now, I can plan ahead. I can think about the future, not just how to make it through the month.”
